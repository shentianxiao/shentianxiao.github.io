I am a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).
Previously, I was a member of technical staff at [Character.AI](https://character.ai/).
Before that, I was a postdoc scholar at the University of Washington.
I received my PhD from MIT and my undergraduate degree from the Yao Class, Tsinghua University.

My research interests are in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
In particular, my research focuses on developing general reinforcement learning frameworks that enable AI agents to autonomously discover knowledge and achieve superhuman performance in complex tasks.
