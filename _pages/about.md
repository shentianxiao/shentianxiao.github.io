I am a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).
Before that, I was a member of technical staff at [Character.AI](https://character.ai/).
Previously, I was a postdoc scholar at the University of Washington, working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).
I received my PhD from MIT, advised by [Regina Barzilay](http://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/) and [Tommi Jaakkola](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/).
I did my undergrad at Tsinghua University, where I was a member of the [Yao Class](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/).

I have broad interests in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning.
My goal is to develop increasingly intelligent models by scaling inference-time search and iteratively learning from successful reasoning chains.
