I am a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).
Previously, I was a member of technical staff at [Character.AI](https://character.ai/).
Before that, I was a postdoc scholar at the University of Washington.
I received my PhD from MIT and my undergraduate degree from the Yao Class, Tsinghua University.

My research interests are in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
In particular, my research focuses on scaling up reinforcement learning to train Gemini to effectively use more tokens during inference, thereby enabling a *thinking* process to achieve superhuman performance on complex tasks.
