I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/index.html).
Previously, I received my PhD from MIT, advised by [Regina Barzilay](http://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/) and [Tommi Jaakkola](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/).
Before that, I did my undergrad at Tsinghua University, where I was a member of the [Yao Class](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/).

I have broad interests in natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning.
More specifically, I study the nature of language and design generative models and algorithms for efficient, accurate, diverse, flexible, and controllable language (and in a wider context, discrete sequence) generation.
